## Project Overview

This a collection of C projects from my "Programming with C" class. I learned some deeper programming concepts like pointers, memory management, and modularity. There were also data structures in this class, like 2D arrays and linked lists. I refactored code in this class by learning ways to enhance and clean my work. For example, I followed the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), and I did not repeat myself (DRY). Overall, these projects helped me understand programming languages and computers on a deeper level.
