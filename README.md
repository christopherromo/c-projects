# C Projects

##### Created by Christopher Romo
##### CS 2060 Programming with C : Fall 2022

---

This a collection of C projects from my "Programming with C" class. They focus on the C programming language while exploring deeper computer science concepts. The class started by focusing on the language itself, teaching concepts like variables, functions, etc. Then, the focus turned to more complex concepts, like pointers and memory management. Finally, concepts like data structures and refactoring were explored. This progression can be seen throughout the projects.

## Technologies

   - C
   - Visual Studio (used for "Programming with C" projects)

## Features

   - **C Projects:** The actual code created for the class. Other than slight polishing, these remain functionally identical to what I turned in. Each C file is one project, with three total projects. 

## Reflection

**The Process:** These projects were created sequentially. Each one built on the previous and introduced new concepts. For the first project, concepts explored include variables, control structures, functions, constants, and input validation. For the second project, concepts explored include passing by reference and 2D arrays. For the final project, concepts explored include structs, pointers, linked lists, and memory management. The first two projects were completed in a 1-2 week period. The final project had 2 iterations over a 2 month period.

**Key Takeaways:** This class introduced me to deeper concepts of computer science. C is a high-level language that is procedural, meaning most concepts from this language can be applied to similar languages. I started by learning how to setup different environments, set up C programs, write C code, compile C programs, and run compiled programs. I then learned deeper concepts like DRY (don't repeat yourself), SRP (single responsibility principle), memory layout (stack and heap), modularity, refactoring techniques, and more. Overall, these projects helped me better understand what's happening under the covers when it comes to programming.

## Running the Files

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open a terminal in the desired C project directory.

3. Compile the C program.
     
   *Example using Clang as the compiler:*
   ```bash
   clang bike_race_fundraiser.c -o bike_race_fundraiser
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./bike_race_fundraiser
   ```
